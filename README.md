# Gymposal

A full stack JavaScript application for friends to create groups and challenge each other to achieve their fitness goals.

## Why I Built This

Similar to many people, I was having a hard time staying motivated to work out. I created this app to track my exercises and incorporate healthy competition amongst friends. Now, I can create multiple groups with various friends and we can all strive towards similar goals while holding each other accountable.
